THIS IS OUTPUT FROM RUNNING THE PROGRAM. AFTER LOADING IT, THE MAIN
MENU FUNCTION CALL, RUN, WAS MADE. THEN IT FOLLOWS THE INPUT DATA AS
SHOWN BY THE USER INTERACTION. THE FACTS ARE SET UP SO THAT THE
BACKWARD CHAINING FAILS FOR TRYING TO PROVE THE ANIMAL IS A ZEBRA,
THEN THE FORWARD CHAINING TAKES PLACE. IF THE HOOFS FACT IS ADDED, AS
SHOWN, THEN FORWARD CHAINING WORKS. IF YOU THEN RELOAD THE WHOLE
SYSTEM AND ADD HOOFS TO THE ORIGINAL FACTS, YOU CAN SEE HOW BACKWARD
CHAINING WORKS WHEN IT CAN PROVE THE RULE. 

YOU DON'T HAVE TO RELOAD EVERYTHING: YOU COULD JUST CHANGE THE FACTS
USING SETF. IF YOU LEAVE THE FACTS AS THEY ARE AFTER FORWARD CHAINING,
IT DOESN'T NEED ANY CHAINING SO IS NOT VERY INTERESTING.

I can't prove the animal is a UNGULATE using the rule

because it does not have CHEW-CUD with truth status of Y.


I can't prove the animal is a UNGULATE using the rule
(UNGULATE ((MAMMAL Y) (HOOFS Y)))
because it does not have HOOFS with truth status of Y.


I can't prove the animal is a ZEBRA using the rule
