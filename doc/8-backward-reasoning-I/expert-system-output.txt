What is the name of your animal you want identified?

Enter the name followed by <RETURN>. 
Remember that the name must be all one word or else hyphenated
stripey

The name you have entered is STRIPEY. Is it correct?

Type `Y' followed by <RETURN> for YES or 'N' and <RETURN> for NO.
y

We know the following facts about STRIPEY: ((GIVE-MILK Y) (HAIR Y) (BLACK-STRIPES Y))

Lets try and prove the animal's identification using backward reasoning.
What animal do you think STRIPEY is? It must be one of the following:
(CHEETAH TIGER GIRAFFE ZEBRA OSTRICH PENGUIN ALBATROSS)

Enter the name followed by <RETURN>. 
Remember that the name must be all one word or else hyphenated
zebra

The name you have entered is ZEBRA. Is it correct?

Type `Y' followed by <RETURN> for YES or 'N' and <RETURN> for NO.
y

OK, you think it is a ZEBRA. Ready to find out whether you are right?

Type `Y' followed by <RETURN> for YES or 'N' and <RETURN> for NO.
y

I can't prove the animal is a UNGULATE using the rule
(UNGULATE ((MAMMAL Y) (CHEW-CUD Y)))
because it does not have CHEW-CUD with truth status of Y.


I can't prove the animal is a UNGULATE using the rule
(UNGULATE ((MAMMAL Y) (HOOFS Y)))
because it does not have HOOFS with truth status of Y.


I can't prove the animal is a ZEBRA using the rule
(ZEBRA ((UNGULATE Y) (BLACK-STRIPES Y)))
because it does not have UNGULATE with truth status of Y.


Sorry, we are not able to find out what STRIPEY is for the reasons stated above.

Would you like us to try and identify your animal using forward reasoning?

Type `Y' followed by <RETURN> for YES or 'N' and <RETURN> for NO.
y

        FORWARD CHAINING
        ----------------

At present, before forward reasoning starts, we know the animal has the following properties:
((GIVE-MILK Y) (HAIR Y) (BLACK-STRIPES Y)).

We will now use forward reasoning with our rule base to try and identify it.
READY TO ROLL?

Type `Y' followed by <RETURN> for YES or 'N' and <RETURN> for NO.
y

OK, LET'S GO
.......
THINKING

------- STILL PROVING A LITTLE TRICKY THIS ONE -------

We are not able to identify the animal with the current *facts.
You will need to provide us with some additional information.

The current known facts are: ((MAMMAL Y) (GIVE-MILK Y) (HAIR Y) (BLACK-STRIPES Y))

Now enter a new fact.

Enter the name followed by <RETURN>. 
Remember that the name must be all one word or else hyphenated
hoofs

The name you have entered is HOOFS. Is it correct?

Type `Y' followed by <RETURN> for YES or 'N' and <RETURN> for NO.
y

Is HOOFS known to be present or absent?
Type `y' followed by <RETURN> for YES (known to be present) or 'n' and <RETURN> for NO (known to be absent).
y

 -------------- GOT IT! ----------------

Your animal is a ZEBRA

The new facts after forward-chaining are: 
((ZEBRA Y) (UNGULATE Y) (HOOFS Y) (MAMMAL Y) (GIVE-MILK Y) (HAIR Y)
 (BLACK-STRIPES Y)).

and STRIPEY is a ZEBRA because it has the following conditions: (BLACK-STRIPES UNGULATE).
